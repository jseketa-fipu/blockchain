# 🧭 Web3 Project Roadmap & Checklist (Vue.js Edition)

A complete learning and development roadmap for your decentralized application (dApp) project.  
Based on *Blockchain aplikacije – 1. online* requirements.

---

## 🧱 Phase 1 – Foundations
🎯 *Goal: Understand blockchain basics and set up your tools.*

- [ ] Learn blockchain fundamentals (blocks, transactions, consensus)
- [ ] Understand private/public keys and wallets
- [ ] Install and set up MetaMask
- [ ] Get Sepolia testnet ETH from a faucet
- [ ] Install VS Code, Node.js, and npm
- [ ] Learn Solidity basics at [solidity-by-example.org](https://solidity-by-example.org)
- [ ] Learn basic command-line and Git usage

---

## ⚙️ Phase 2 – Smart Contract
🎯 *Goal: Write and deploy your first Solidity smart contract.*

- [ ] Install **Hardhat** and initialize a project
- [ ] Write your first contract (e.g., Greeting, Voting, Todo List)
- [ ] Test the contract locally using Hardhat
- [ ] Deploy to **Sepolia testnet** via Alchemy or Infura
- [ ] Verify the contract on [Sepolia Etherscan](https://sepolia.etherscan.io) (optional)
- [ ] Interact with your contract (via Remix, Hardhat scripts, or console)
- [ ] Keep notes of your deployed contract address and ABI

---

## 🌐 Phase 3 – Frontend (Vue.js)
🎯 *Goal: Build a simple Web3 interface with Vue.js and ethers.js.*

- [ ] Create a new Vue.js project (`npm create vue@latest my-dapp`)
- [ ] Install **ethers.js** (`npm install ethers`)
- [ ] Connect to MetaMask and request wallet access
- [ ] Display connected wallet address and ETH balance
- [ ] Read on-chain data from your smart contract
- [ ] Call write functions (send transactions)
- [ ] Create a clean UI to display and update blockchain state


## 🧩 Phase 4 – Modular & Advanced Contracts
🎯 *Goal: Design a more advanced or modular on-chain system.*

- [ ] Add multiple smart contracts (ERC-20 token, NFT, DAO, Marketplace)
- [ ] Use **OpenZeppelin** libraries for security and standards
- [ ] Add inheritance and modular contract design
- [ ] Use **events** to update frontend dynamically
- [ ] Optimize gas usage and improve logic clarity
- [ ] Write **unit tests** for all smart contracts

💡 *Example:*  
One contract for tokens, one for marketplace listings, and one for user management.

---

## 🚀 Phase 5 – Full Web3 Application
🎯 *Goal: Integrate all layers into a full Web3 dApp.*

- [ ] Integrate **frontend + smart contracts**
- [ ] Optionally add **backend (Node.js, Express, or Python FastAPI)**
- [ ] Store metadata or files on **IPFS** or **Pinata**
- [ ] Implement **Sign-In With Ethereum (SIWE)** or wallet-based login
- [ ] Document your project architecture and tools
- [ ] Create screenshots or a short demo video
- [ ] Publish your code to GitHub (with README + setup guide)

📦 Example tech stack:
| Layer | Description | Tools |
|--------|--------------|--------|
| Smart Contracts | Core on-chain logic | Solidity + Hardhat + OpenZeppelin |
| Blockchain | Testnet deployment | Sepolia + Alchemy/Infura |
| Frontend | Web3 interface | Vue.js + ethers.js + MetaMask |
| Backend (optional) | Off-chain helper logic | Node.js + Express |
| Storage (optional) | Metadata / assets | IPFS + Pinata |
| Documentation | Project overview | Markdown + screenshots |

---

## 🔐 Phase 6 – Security & Best Practices
🎯 *Goal: Make your smart contracts and app secure.*

- [ ] Avoid reentrancy and overflow vulnerabilities
- [ ] Use **Checks-Effects-Interactions** pattern
- [ ] Apply access control with `Ownable` or `Roles`
- [ ] Use **Slither** or **Mythril** for static analysis
- [ ] Simulate attack and edge cases in tests
- [ ] Optionally use a **multisig wallet** (e.g. Gnosis Safe) for admin functions

---

## 🎓 Final Deliverables
- [ ] Smart contract source code (Solidity)
- [ ] Deployed contract address on **Sepolia**
- [ ] Vue.js frontend source code
- [ ] README with architecture overview and setup instructions
- [ ] Demo video or screenshots of app interaction
- [ ] Optional: GitHub repo with full project history
